            <p>
                I specialise in building web applications that work beautifully in any device. I embrace open source technology. The
                majority of the sites are powered by Drupal and WordPress on the backend. More recently I have been developing with React.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take pride in my ability to work on both the creative and technical sides of the digital trade. The industry has undergone
                substantial changes. I embrace this and continously adopt new techniques and technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Design is very important to me. I love to see visions come to life. Using react enables me to build slick interfaces that
                are not constrained by any template.
            </p>

            <p>
                I pride myself in adhering to high coding standards and rigorous testing. This means your website or app will run as
                expected and is scalable so new features can be seamlessly added.
